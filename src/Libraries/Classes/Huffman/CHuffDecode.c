We can however**	take a shortcut by reading HUFFLOOKUPBITS bits at a time. If the**	code we reach is shorter than this, all we need to do is back up**	a few bits. If we did not reach a leaf node with the lookup, we**	continue bit by bit until we reach a leaf.****	This routine creates the lookup table for HUFFLOOKUPBITS bits and**	it creates a table of lengths so that we can find out how many bits**	were needed for the last char.****	Recursion has been eliminated with a stack and the routine is a**	modified version of the one used to create the tables in the encoder**	object.****	The routine goes through the patterns in order starting with 000... and ending**	at 111... Because of this, the "holes" in the lookup table can be filled**	as we go. The last pointer written to the table has to be replicated until**	the end of the table.*/void	CHuffDecode::CreateLookupBuffer(){	short			lastLookup;	short			walkerStack[33];	short			*stackPtr;	short			codeLen = 1;	long			codeString = 0;	HuffTreeNode	*theNode;	HuffTreeNode	*lastNode;	theNode = BuildTree();		stackPtr = walkerStack+1;		*stackPtr++ = theNode->right;	theNode = &nodes[theNode->left];	lastLookup = 0;	do	{	if(codeLen == HUFFLOOKUPBITS || (theNode->left < 0 && codeLen < HUFFLOOKUPBITS))		{	long			codeIndex;			short			i;						codeIndex = codeString << (HUFFLOOKUPBITS - codeLen);			lastNode = lookupBuf[lastLookup];			while(lastLookup < codeIndex)			{	lookupBuf[lastLookup++] = lastNode;			}						lookupBuf[codeIndex] = theNode;								}				if(theNode->left < 0)		{	codeLengths[theNode->right] = codeLen;			theNode = &nodes[*--stackPtr];			while(codeString & 1)			{	codeLen--;				codeString >>= 1;			};			codeString |= 1;				}		else		{	*stackPtr++ = theNode->right;			theNode = &nodes[theNode->left];			codeLen++;			codeString += codeString;		}	}	while(stackPtr != walkerStack);		lastNode = lookupBuf[lastLookup];	while(lastLookup < HUFFLOOKUPSIZE)	{	lookupBuf[lastLookup++] = lastNode;	}}/***	Decodes Huffman encoded data.*/OSErr	CHuffDecode::PipeData(	Ptr		dataPtr,	long	len){	OSErr	theErr = noErr;	long	bitsInBuffer;	Boolean	decodeOk;	//	Process "len" input bytes.	while(len)	{	long			byteRoom;		long			bitData;		long			*bitPointer;		unsigned char 	*p;				//	Copy some data to temp buffer.		byteRoom = BITBUFFERSIZE - bytesInBuffer;		if(byteRoom > len) byteRoom = len;		//	Find out where to write the data.		p = bitBuffer + bytesInBuffer;		//	Mark the bytes as moved.		bytesInBuffer += byteRoom;		len -= byteRoom;		//	Move the bytes.		while(byteRoom--)		{	*p++ = (unsigned char)(*dataPtr++);		}				//	Update bitsInBuffer to reflect the moved data.		bitsInBuffer = bytesInBuffer << 3;		//	Decode data until we run out of bits.		decodeOk = true;		do		{	HuffTreeNode	*theNode;			short			theCode;			//	Read in some bits into bitData.			bitPointer = (long *)(bitBuffer + (bitPosition >> 3));#ifdef INTEL_ARCH			{	unsigned char	*charPointer = (unsigned char*)bitPointer;							bitData = 	(	((long)charPointer[0] << 24) |								((long)charPointer[1] << 16) |								((long)charPointer[2] << 8)  |								 (long)charPointer[3]			) << (bitPosition & 7);			}#else			bitData = (*bitPointer) << (bitPosition & 7);#endif						//	Use the lookup table to see what these bits decode to:			theNode = lookupBuf[(bitData >> (32 - HUFFLOOKUPBITS)) & (HUFFLOOKUPSIZE-1)];						//	If we didn't reach a leaf node, proceed bit by bit.			if(theNode->left >= 0)			{	long		mask = 1L << (31 - HUFFLOOKUPBITS);							do	//	Decode one bit at a time and walk the tree.				{					if(mask & bitData)	theNode = nodes + theNode->right;						else			theNode = nodes + theNode->left;										mask >>= 1;				} while(theNode->left >= 0);			}						//	Move the decoded symbol to theCode			theCode = theNode->right;						//	Mark n bits as read.			bitPosition += codeLengths[theCode];						//	If we haven't read past the end of the buffer, decode was ok.			if(bitPosition < bitsInBuffer)			{	outputBuffer[outputPosition++] = theCode;				symbCounters[theCode]++;				//	Flush output buffer, if necessary.				if(outputPosition >= DECODEBUFFERSIZE)				{	if(outputStream)					{	theErr = outputStream->PipeData((Ptr)outputBuffer, outputPosition);						if(theErr)	decodeOk = false;					}					outputPosition = 0;				}				dataCount++;				if(CHANGEOFPATTERNS)				{	CreateLookupBuffer();				}			} 			else	//	We tried to read past the end.
